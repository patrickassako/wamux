# ### Story 5.1: Public Landing Page (Next.js)

As a visitor,
I want to understand the product's value proposition immediately,
So that I am convinced to sign up for a trial.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I visit the root domain
**When** the page loads
**Then** I should see a Hero Section with "Connect WhatsApp in 30s"
**And** a Pricing Grid comparing Free vs Pro plans
**And** a "Get Started" cta that links to the Registration Page (Epic 1)
