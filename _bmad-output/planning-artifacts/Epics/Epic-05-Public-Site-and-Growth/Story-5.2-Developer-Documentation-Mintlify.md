# ### Story 5.2: Developer Documentation (Mintlify)

As a developer,
I want beautiful, searchable documentation with code snippets,
So that I can integrate the API quickly without guessing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a Mintlify-hosted documentation site
**When** I visit `/docs`
**Then** I should see the "Authentication", "Sending Messages", and "Webhooks" sections
**And** each endpoint should have curl/Node/Python examples
**And** I should be able to "Try it out" (if Mintlify API playground is enabled)
