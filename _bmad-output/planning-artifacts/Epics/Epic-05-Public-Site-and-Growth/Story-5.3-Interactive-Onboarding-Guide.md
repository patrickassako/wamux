# ### Story 5.3: Interactive Onboarding Guide

As a new user,
I want a step-by-step wizard after signing up,
So that I don't feel lost in the dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a newly registered user
**When** they first login
**Then** a 3-step wizard should appear:
1. "Create API Key"
2. "Connect WhatsApp Session"
3. "Send Test Message"
**And** completion of the wizard should unlock the full dashboard
